        <strong>Warning:</strong> Use with caution. Data recovery feature should only be used in cases where the liquibase based 
         incremental data upgradation is failed. This will reset the script and related data to the latest release data.
         The execution and device data in your instance will be retained. But the additional scripts and related data will be lost. 
         Before proceeding with this take a backup of your database. For more details, please refer the rdkcentral wiki pages.
